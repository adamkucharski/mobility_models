# mobility_models
Repository with some common mobility models, allowing users to define a connectivity matrix if parameters are known.

This is designed to be a complement to other packages like {[mobility](https://github.com/COVID-19-Mobility-Data-Network/mobility)https://github.com/COVID-19-Mobility-Data-Network/mobility} that fit to data to estimate parameters from mobility matrices.
